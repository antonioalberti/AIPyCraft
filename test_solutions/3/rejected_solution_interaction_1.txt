Rejected Solution:
Component 1: Create a class TextFileReader to handle the reading of a text file. This class should include methods to open a file by its path, read its content, and output the text into a variable for further processing. This class will be in a file named text_file_reader.py.

File 1: text_file_reader.py

Component 2: Implement the main program in a file named main.py that imports the TextFileReader class. The program will request a file path from the user, utilize the TextFileReader class to read the file, and print the content. Include an if __name__ == "__main__": block at the end of the main.py program to initialize and run the Solution.

File 2: main.py
